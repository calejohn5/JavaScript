# My JavaScript Directory

This will house my JavaScript work     * (initialized 10/08/2020)

## Everything is it's own independent project aside from MISC.

Most of this code is new, as I failed to save my previous code from school aside from my last semester.
MISC is my homework dump that I managed to save and various stuff I test around with.



### I am currently working on my git/organization skills including this README file.
